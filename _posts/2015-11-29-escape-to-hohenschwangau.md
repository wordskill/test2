Actually, they probably won't say Hohenschwangau - that name hardly rolls off the tongue - but that will be what they mean when they say "That cool little tourist village surrounded by mountains and overlooked by a big yellow castle and an even bigger white castle".

You have almost certainly already seen that big white castle before, it is one of the most photographed buildings in the world, looking somewhat similar to that fairytale castle displayed at the start of Disney movies, but perching high among, steep, dark green, gothically ominous mountains.

[aesop_content color="#333333" background="#FFFFFF" columns="2" position="none" imgrepeat="no-repeat" floaterposition="left" floaterdirection="up"]When in Munich, Hohenschwangau is somewhere that you escape to because it is actually 120 kilometers to the south of Munich, but it is well worth the trip because of the two afore-mentioned castles - the big yellow castle is Schloss Hohenschwangau (Schloss is German for "palace", but is also interchangeable with the word "castle" in English) and the big white, fairytale castle is Schloss Neuschwanstein. There is also another castle worth seeing, Schloss Linderhof, just a few miles outside the village. We have separate articles about all three of them, but this article is about the village itself.

[aesop_content color="#333333" background="#FFFFFF" columns="2" position="none" imgrepeat="no-repeat" floaterposition="left" floaterdirection="up"]Hohenschwangau seems to be entirely geared towards serving the endless flow of tourists who arrive to view the castles. Most arrive in coaches that park in a big car park in the middle of the village, but a lot of people arrive in cars too - it usually takes me about an hour and a half to drive there from Munich. In the village you will find restaurants, hotels, souvenir stores etc., but you will no doubt be eager to start climbing the steep road up to the yellow castle directly overlooking the village, Schloss Hohenschwangau.

The view from Schloss Hohenschwangau is terrific up there, the village looks particularly cute from above, but you will find yourself increasingly drawn to staring up at the white fairytale castle, Schloss Neuschwanstein, and you will no doubt be eager to get up there as soon as possible. The roads to the castles are well sign-posted and the village itself is designed to be as easy as possible for visitors.
