When visiting Nymphenburg Castle, I always enjoy the sitting down by the lake outside for a few reflective minutes and watch the antics of the gang of swans that have made their home there.

My experiments include confirming that they seem to understand both the German and the English language, which I consider to be a fine reflection on the German educational system. I have been to university and still only manage a few shaky phrases in the Swan language - it is very hard to get the tones right, they tell me I'm a semitone off. I'm learning how to say "I ring your bloody necks" in Swan"  So better get down to see them before my next visit.
