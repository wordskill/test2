[aesop_content color="#333333" background="#FFFFFF" width="100%" columns="2" position="none" imgrepeat="no-repeat" floaterposition="left" floaterdirection="up"]The very embodiment of a fairytale castle, Schloss Neuschwanstein (Neuschwanstein Palace) is one of the most iconic structures of the 19th Century. Well worth the journey of under two hours from Munich, you can put this attraction firmly in the category of "must-see". Until such time as you can see it in real-life, we have put together five galleries that will fill your eyes with some lovely sights and your brain with some fascinating details. The galleries are this one, which features photos, taken outside, of the castle itself and a few of the surrounding area, to give you an idea of what to expect when you visit. The second gallery will show you <a href="http://guide.munichescape.dev/inside-neuschwanstein-castle/">the well-preserved and historically interesting interiors</a>. The third gallery shows some of the excellent views from the castle. The forth is a short slideshow early photographs that have somehow survived from the time of the construction of Schloss Neuschwanstein. Finally, the fifth gallery should really press your romantic buttons: <a href="http://guide.munichescape.dev/a-winter-fairytale-neuschwanstein-castle-in-the-snow-and-fog/">dramatic shots of Schloss Neuschwanstein in the dead of winter</a> - you may need a log fire and a hot Irish whiskey after viewing those chilly images.
