When I say that Munich's subway system is "naked", I am talking about this interesting image by artist Neil Freeman, depicting the Munich U-Bahn system stripped of all the usual colors and text labels.

Seeing it as a simple network, we can admire the simple functionality of the system we are so familiar with that we usually don't even notice it.
