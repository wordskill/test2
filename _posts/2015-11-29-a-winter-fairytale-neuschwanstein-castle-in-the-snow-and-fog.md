You will need warm clothes, but a visit to Schloss Neuschwanstein at this time of year is something you will never forget.

You also should not forget that this Munich Vacation Guide includes a grand total of five slideshows featuring this lickably delicious castle. There is the main one, featuring <a href="http://guide.munichescape.dev/neuschwanstein-a-castle-worth-gazing-upon/">shots of Schloss Neuschwanstein in the Spring and Summer</a>, there is one of featuring the views from the castle, there is another featuring <a href="http://guide.munichescape.dev/inside-neuschwanstein-castle/">the beautifully preserved interior rooms</a> and there is even one displaying fascinating photos that have somehow survived from the Nineteenth Century construction of the castle. So, after all that lot, you won't even need to go see it for yourself. Just kidding!
